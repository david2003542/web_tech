### [React Props & State] (https://codeburst.io/props-and-state-in-react-native-explained-in-simple-english-8ea73b1d224e)
 - Props **__Immutable__** 
   - All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
 - State
   - State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
   - **__Do Not Modify State Directly__**
     - use `setState()`
   - **__State Updates May Be Asynchronous__**
     - `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.
   - **__State Updates are Merged__**



### Lifecycle
 - itâ€™s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.
